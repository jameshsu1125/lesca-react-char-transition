# Why use it?

xxxxxx [gitHub](https://github.com/jameshsu1125) plugin.

See <https://github.com/jameshsu1125/> for a demonstration!

#### [Live Demo](https://www.npmjs.com/~jameshsu1125)

# Installation

```sh
npm install <package> --save
```

## Usage

As a Node module:

```javascript
import foo from 'foo';
```

In the compnenet

```javascript
const component = () => {
  const [state, setState] = setState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);

  return <div />;
};
```

### Features

- TypeScript
- Code Formatting ([prettier])
- Code Linting ([eslint])
- Testing and coverage ([jest])
- Continuous Integration ([GitHub Actions])
- Bundled as both UMD and ESM ([rollup])
- Upload as [NPM] package and [unpkg] CDN
- Simple demonstration website ([GitHub Pages])
- maintain if necessary

### Getting Started

1. Create a GitHub repository [from the template](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. Replace package details in the following files:
   - `package.json`
   - `LICENSE`
   - `README.md`
   - `rollup.config.js`
3. Install the `node_module` dependencies: `npm install` or `npm ci` (see [Install a project with a clean slate](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-ci)).
4. Run code formatting; `npm run format`, and linting: `npm run lint:fix`.
5. Run the unit tests; `npm test`, or with coverage; `npm test -- --coverage`.

Now you can start to adapt the code in `src/index.ts` for your plugin, starting with the [markdown-it development recommendations](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/development.md).

Modify the test in `tests/fixtures.spec.ts`, to load your plugin, then the "fixtures" in `tests/fixtures`, to provide a set of potential Markdown inputs and expected HTML outputs.

On commits/PRs to the `master` branch, the GH actions will trigger, running the linting, unit tests, and build tests.
Additionally setup and uncomment the [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) action in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, to provide automated CI coverage.

Finally, you can update the version of your package, e.g.: `npm version patch -m "ðŸš€ RELEASE: v%s"`, push to GitHub; `git push --follow-tags`, build; `npm run build`, and publish; `npm publish`.

Finally, you can adapt the HTML document in `docs/`, to load both markdown-it and the plugin (from [unpkg]), then render text from an input area.
This can be deployed by [GitHub Pages].

## Design choices

### Why is markdown-it only in devDependencies?

From the [markdown-it development recommendations](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/development.md):

> Plugins should not require the `markdown-it` package as a dependency in `package.json`.

Note, for typing, we import this package with `import type`, to ensure the imports are not present in the compiled JavaScript.

### Why Jest?

There are a number of JavaScript unit testing frameworks (see [this comparison](https://raygun.com/blog/javascript-unit-testing-frameworks/), but [jest] was chosen because of it is easy to setup/use, flexible, and well used in large projects.

### Why Rollup?

The three main bundlers are; Webpack, Rollup and Parcel, with the functionality gap between all of these bundlers narrowing over the years.
Essentially, Rollup provides a middle ground between features and complexity, and is good for bundling libraries (it is what `markdown-it` itself [uses](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/064d602c6890715277978af810a903ab014efc73/support/rollup.config.js)).
